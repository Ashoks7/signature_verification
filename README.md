# Fake Image Detection Model README


## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a machine learning model for detecting fake images. The objective of this model is to determine whether an image provided corresponds to a real or fake image of a customer based on their ID. The dataset consists of images categorized by customer IDs from 1 to 55, with each folder containing both real and fake images.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for this task is based on the VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, with additional custom layers added on top for classification. VGG16 is a widely-used CNN architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition tasks.

The custom layers added on top of the VGG16 base consist of a Flatten layer followed by a Dense layer with ReLU activation and another Dense layer with softmax activation for binary classification (real or fake).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of customers categorized by their IDs. Each folder in the dataset contains real and fake images corresponding to a particular customer ID. The dataset organization is crucial for proper training and evaluation of the model.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Data Organization**: Ensure that your dataset is organized according to the provided structure. Each customer's images should be placed in separate folders labeled with their respective IDs.

2. **Train-Test Split**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the provided code snippet or any other method of your choice. Ensure that both sets maintain the balance of real and fake images.

### Data Augmentation

Utilize data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability. The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use the `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow/Keras for data augmentation.

### Model Training

1. **Model Configuration**: Configure the VGG16-based model with custom layers for fake image detection as shown in the provided code snippet.

2. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics using the `compile` method.

3. **Training**: Train the model using the augmented training data generated by the `ImageDataGenerator` and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

### Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it for inference by providing an input image. The model will output a probability score indicating the likelihood of the input image being real or fake.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Pillow (PIL)
- scikit-learn (for train-test split)
